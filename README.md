# PacketSniffer (for VMWare/MiddlePC)


**Note**: make sure your vmware instance or middle pc is in the same LAN as your game pc.(vmware instance should use bridged network)
Here is an easy way using [arpspoof](https://github.com/alandau/arpspoof/releases/tag/v0.1) to redirect packets from your game pc to a middle pc.

# Windows (VMWare/MiddlePC)

Follow the following instructions on your vmware or middle pc
1. Enable IP Routing [Follow This Guide](http://keepthetech.com/2016/01/enable-ip-routing-on-windows10.html) *Note* This stops your connection from lagging out.
1. run in Command Prompt 'arpsoof.exe <game_pc_ip>'
2. Run in Command Prompt 'java -jar pubg-radar-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <middle_pc_ip> PortFilter <game_pc_ip>'

**Note** Load the Pubg Radar in the Menu, Press your "Push to Talk" Keybind once ingame. 

# Windows (Game PC Only)
